/*
Given a graph of n nodes, each node has a cost asscociated. There are some edges present and we need to add few more to connect this graph. We can add an edge between nodes u and v if cost(u) >= 0 and cost(v) >= 0. Construction of edge costs -> cost(u) + cost(v). Find the min cost to connect the graph.
